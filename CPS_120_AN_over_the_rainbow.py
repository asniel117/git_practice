#  Description:
#       <This is a simple print function.
#        variable (over_the_rainbow) will hold a long
#        string with the proper formatting. print() will
#        display that string.>

# This is the variable holding the string. The string uses triple quotes to
# hold a large string. I also use \n to go to the next line. 
over_the_rainbow = '''
Somewhere over the rainbow way up high,\n
There's a land that I heard of once in a lullaby.\n
Somewhere over the rainbow skies are blue,\n
And the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true.\n
\n
Somewhere over the rainbow bluebirds fly.\n
Birds fly over the rainbow. Why then, oh why can't I?
'''
# This is the print function. It will print the variable over_the_rainbow.
